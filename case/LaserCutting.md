The two svg files are intended to fit on a 20" X 30" panel, with a slight slope using a feed-through slot. Rearrange the parts as needed.
The jsl file is a JMP scripting language file that produced the svg files. Nothing magic there, and it really wants some attention if it is used again. Possibly you'll want the 6 through-screw mounting holes slightly larger. They can be a tight fit when the case warps a bit.

The svg panels are suposed to fit together like this, notice the middle is narrow (top to bottom) on the left, etc.
